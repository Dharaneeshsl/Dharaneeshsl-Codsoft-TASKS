# Handwritten Text Generation with RNN - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. The model learns patterns from handwritten text examples and generates new text that mimics handwriting styles.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **Character-level RNN Model**: A neural network architecture designed to learn and generate text at the character level.
2. **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: A system to create training data that simulates handwritten text.
3. **Text Generation System**: A mechanism to generate new text based on learned patterns.
4. **Text Visualization**: A component to display generated text in a handwriting-like style.

### Key Files
- `src/handwritten_text_rnn.py`: Main RNN model implementation
- `src/generate_dataset.py`: Script to generate synthetic handwritten text dataset
- `src/train_and_generate.py`: Script to train the model and generate text
- `src/evaluate_model.py`: Script to evaluate the quality of generated text
- `src/run_demo.py`: Demo script to showcase the model
- `src/simple_demo.py`: Simplified demo that doesn't require full model training
- `main.py`: Main entry point with command-line interface

### Features
- Character-level RNN for text generation
- Synthetic handwritten text dataset generation
- Text visualization to mimic handwriting styles
- Customizable text generation parameters
- Evaluation metrics for generated text quality

## Demo Results
The project includes a simple demo that visualizes generated text with handwriting-like characteristics:

1. The demo uses a simple character model to generate text from seed phrases
2. It then visualizes this text with random variations to simulate handwriting
3. The output is saved as PNG images in the output directory

## Usage Instructions
The project can be used in several ways:

1. **Simple Demo**: Run `python main.py --action simple-demo` to see a quick demonstration without training a full model
2. **Full Training**: Run `python main.py --action train` to train a complete RNN model on synthetic data
3. **Text Generation**: Run `python main.py --action generate --seed "Your text"` to generate handwritten-like text from a seed phrase
4. **Model Evaluation**: Run `python main.py --action evaluate` to assess the quality of the generated text

## Future Improvements
1. Implement more advanced RNN architectures (LSTM, GRU)
2. Use real handwritten text datasets for training
3. Add style transfer capabilities for different handwriting styles
4. Implement attention mechanisms for better text generation
5. Create a web interface for interactive text generation
