# Handwritten Text Generation with RNN

## Setup
- [x] Create necessary project structure
- [x] Install required libraries
- [x] Import necessary modules

## Data Preparation
- [x] Find/download a dataset of handwritten text examples
- [x] Preprocess the dataset for training
- [x] Create data loaders for training

## Model Implementation
- [x] Implement character-level RNN architecture
- [x] Define loss function and optimizer
- [x] Set up training loop

## Training
- [x] Train the model on the dataset
- [x] Monitor training progress
- [x] Save the trained model

## Text Generation
- [x] Implement text generation function
- [x] Generate sample handwritten-like text
- [x] Visualize or display the generated text

## Evaluation
- [x] Evaluate the quality of generated text
- [x] Make improvements if necessary
